# Motivation
This project considers the setting of a pandemic outbreak. During this outbreak, it is assumed there are a set of parameters, θ, that can be controlled by public policy. The vision of this project is to give the policymakers at any time, sets of optimal parameters θ<sup>*</sup>, so that the public health risks can be reduced as small as possible.

The question is hence raised to what extent should we mitigate the pandemics? Intuitively, we would like to give θ<sup>*</sup> such that it will achieve the virus-free outcome. However, under the assumptions, nudging θ towards such θ<sup>*</sup> by implementing policy has increasing cost, meaning that such θ<sup>*</sup> will potentially impose infeasible government expenses.

Due to this cost constraint, we introduce the hospital capacity as the mitigation threshold for
choosing such θ <sup>*</sup>. In contrast to the virus-free outcome, this not only makes sure the pandemics are well contained and managed under the healthcare capacity, but ultimately, as the motivation of this project, achieving the lowest government expenses.
